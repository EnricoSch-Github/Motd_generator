# Motd_generator atm works only with 1.12 Servers

Hey, this a program which should facilitate to change the motd of each server.

What it does: 
Currently it creates a Folder in C:\MotdList
With the name of the Input, and that create a folder with the modpack name and a .txt document with motd context
And a Customplayerlist.txt

How to enhance this: change the directory where the server has the motd context inside
